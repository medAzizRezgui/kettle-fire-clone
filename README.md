# kettle-fire-clone


a project that I am currently working on.



It's a clone for shoppify website ( Kettle & Fire ) 



I am building it with React using Typescript and Chakra-UI .

For now I just finished the UI for the landing page and in the future I am going to implement :



* Authentication and database using firebase and firestore

* Shopping cart logic 

* multiple pages for shops and products
